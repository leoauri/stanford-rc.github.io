# IBM AC922
## Redhat 7
## Advance Toolchain
To enable the [IBM Advance toolchain tools](https://developer.ibm.com/linuxonpower/advance-toolchain/) 
use the modules setup system:

 * Enable Advance toolchain (AT)
```
module load at12.0
```
 * Disable AT
```
module unload at12.0
```

For additional settings please see [IBM documentation](https://developer.ibm.com/linuxonpower/advance-toolchain/adv-tool-usage).

## NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit
CUDA Toolkit installed at `/usr/local/cuda` is a link to `/usr/local/cuda-10.2`. 
See [NVIDIA docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#numa-best-practices).

## Container usage on AC922
### Tooling
Docker is not installed on the machines (and most likely never will be), so 
enroot needs to be used for using containers.

> Enroot is a simple, yet powerful tool to turn traditional container/OS images 
into unprivileged sandboxes. To use on the AC922 the enroot-directories need to 
be set up to the `/scratch` folder, because of permission issues on the network drive!

```
export XDG_DATA_HOME=/scratch/YOURNAME/enroot-data
export XDG_CACHE_HOME=/scratch/YOURNAME/enroot-data
```
After the configuration you can easily download images from e.g. dockerhub and use them.

```
$ enroot import docker://ubuntu
$ enroot create ubuntu.sqsh
$ enroot start ubuntu bash
```
### Images

Since the AC922s have PowerPC architecture, most images won't run directly, 
since they have been built for `x86`. Please use the correct architecture 
`ppc64le` for docker images. The may have different formats.

```
docker search cuda | grep ppc64le
docker.io   docker.io/nvidia/cuda-ppc64le                            CUDA and cuDNN images from gitlab.com/nvid...   13

```
For CUDA related images please make sure that you use the correct CUDA version...

```
enroot import docker://docker.io/nvidia/cuda-ppc64le:10.2
```
```
docker search hello-world | grep ppc64le
docker.io   docker.io/ppc64le/hello-world                        Hello World! (an example of minimal Docker...   2
```
#### Recommendation for Images

**[Tensorflow-ppc64le](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/tensorflow-ppc64le)** 
Images from the IBM Community, not sure how up-to date 
the version is. 

**[PowerAI-Images](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/powerai)** Official Docker 
images from Nvidia, unfortunately a bit outdated. (Tensorflow 2.1/PyTorch 1.3.1). 

[Self-Built docker images](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/maxscha/cuda_pytorch_jupyter), 
built with different version combinations of Python & 
PyTorch. Currently only PyTorch, but has the latest versions.

## PyTorch Environment
There is a [post on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64528124 ) 
that summarizes how to get a running PyTorch environment on PowerPC.

Note that it might be best to also use anaconda to set up your other dependencies 
and you might also be able to install other packages the same way ([package list](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/software/server/ibm-ai/conda-early-access/)).

## Tensorflow
(Untested) The latest build version of Tensorflow can be downloaded from [here ](https://powerci.osuosl.org/job/TensorFlow2_PPC64LE_GPU_Release_Build/) as wheel package, and should be installable via conda.
