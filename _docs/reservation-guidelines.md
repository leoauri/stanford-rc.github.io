# Reservation guidelines

To book, create an appointment in your calendar application or OWA and *invite* 
the calendar for the resource you need. 

## Guidelines

Please stick to the following guidelines when booking your resources:

### Only use resources you reserved:
If you do not have a reservation on a resource, please refrain from using 
it. Particularly, resources that are reserved *exclusively* are off limits 
since even simple `ssh` connections might disturb a benchmark. 

If you just want to have a look around the lab or a resource,
   * use [Summon](/docs/summon) to start or host your sessions,
   * pick a "shared" or un-reserved resource to quickly have a look around,
   * please do not linger, 
   * and if in doubt, make a reservation or discuss with others or the SCORE team.

### Announce when you need exclusive access:
Specify either **shared** or **exclusive** in the appointment's title, depending 
on the kind of access you need.

For the cluster nodes, include *which* cluster nodes you are reserving.

### Pick a good time frame:
Reservations shouldn't be too short (eg, just a few minutes) nor too long 
(longer than 4 to 5 days).
  
There might be exceptions to this (experimenting, paper deadlines etc.) but 
generally **half-a-day to 4 days** is a good time frame.

### Use full-day reservations if applicable:
If you book anything longer than half-a-day and the resource is not booked 
too tightly, please prefer **full-day** reservations.

### Don't change booking unnecessarily:

Please do **not** forward-move your reservations if you are not done with your 
work, make a new reservation.

Also, please do **not** extend existing reservations. If you want to continue 
to work with your resource, make a new reservation.

### Give others a chance:
The DELab resources are shared among the users of the lab. If you are not on 
a tight deadline, please give others a chance to book resources. That means please 
   * do not book excessive time frames,
   * do not book excessive consecutive reservations for the same resource, and 
   * do not book "exclusive" resources when "shared" are sufficient.

### If in doubt, ask:
If there is any question whether a resource is free or reserved, or whether others 
intend to use it, please ask.
For that, you can discuss with other users on the "delab-announce" mailing 
list or contact the SCORE team at score-lab@....
